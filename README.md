# School Management System Documentation

## 1. Project Overview

The School Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to address challenges in the educational management sector. It aims to streamline various administrative tasks, including student admissions, teacher registration, transaction management, attendance tracking, result management, and class routine creation. The system is intended to provide a centralized platform for managing all aspects of school administration.

## 2. Project Team

The project team consists of:

- **Najmus Sakib Rashid:** Responsible for designing the database, front-end, and back-end development.
- **Jamil Ahmed:** Responsible for UI design.

## 3. Project Planning

The project planning involves several key milestones:

- **Week 1:** Project scope fixation
- **Week 2:** Connecting to the database
- **Week 3:** Providing Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
- **Week 4:** Describing the relational scheme
- **Week 5:** Full-stack development milestone 1
- **Week 6:** Full-stack development milestone 2

## 4. Technical Details

### 4.1 Database (MySQL)

The database consists of several tables:

- `student`: Stores information about students.
- `teacher`: Contains details about teachers.
- `attendance`: Records student attendance.
- `parents`: Manages information about parents.
- ... (and other tables as described in the provided schema)

### 4.2 Backend (Node.js)

The backend is developed using Node.js, and it includes APIs for various functionalities:

- **Student API:**
  ```javascript
  // Example endpoint for retrieving student information
  app.get('/api/students/:id', (req, res) => {
    // Code to retrieve student information
    // ...
    res.json(studentData);
  });
  ```

- **Attendance API:**
  ```javascript
  // Example endpoint for recording attendance
  app.post('/api/attendance', (req, res) => {
    // Code to record attendance
    // ...
    res.json({ success: true });
  });
  ```

### 4.3 Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS)

The frontend is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a user-friendly interface.

## 5. Code Documentation

Code is documented using standard conventions. For example:

- **Backend Code:**
  ```javascript
  // Function to retrieve student information by ID
  function getStudentById(studentId) {
    // Code implementation
    // ...
    return studentData;
  }
  ```

- **Frontend Code:**
  ```javascript
  // Event listener for the attendance recording button
  document.getElementById('recordAttendanceBtn').addEventListener('click', () => {
    // Code to handle attendance recording
    // ...
  });
  ```

## 6. System Architecture

The system follows a three-tier architecture:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JS for the user interface.
- **Backend:** Node.js for server-side logic and API endpoints.
- **Database:** MySQL for data storage.

This architecture ensures modularity and scalability.
